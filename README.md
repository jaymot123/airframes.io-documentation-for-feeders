- 👋 Hi, I’m @jaymot123 (JayM)
- 👀 I’m interested in ADS-B, ACARS, HFDL, shortwave listening, other SDR and radio monitoring activities.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for my ham radio license exam.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, I'm not a coder. I only created this repository to share some documentation that I wrote.
- 📫 How to reach me: best bet is in Discord on the ADSBExchange server in the #welcome channel. No DMs please.
